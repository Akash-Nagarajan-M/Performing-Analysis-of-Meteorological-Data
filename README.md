# Performing Analysis of Meteorological Data

This project focuses on analyzing meteorological data and understanding the relationship between apparent temperature and humidity for each month from 2006 to 2016. The following plots represent the apparent temperature vs humidity for all 12 months. Based on these plots, we arrive at a conclusion that global warming has caused significant temperature changes during these years, with noticeable ups and downs in the temperature trends.

## Analysis Plots

Below are the plots representing apparent temperature vs humidity for each month:

## Conclusion

The analysis of apparent temperature and humidity data suggests that there are notable temperature variations throughout the years 2006 to 2016. However, the average humidity has remained relatively constant during this period. These findings indicate the impact of global warming on temperature changes and emphasize the need for further research and actions to address climate-related concerns.
